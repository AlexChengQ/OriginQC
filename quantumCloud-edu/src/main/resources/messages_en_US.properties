#backend_register
qcode_demo1_desc=The D-J algorithm is a quantum algorithm that determines whether a function is "balanced" or "constant". In the case of classical algorithms, one needs to try half of the possible sets to get the answer, while in the quantum algorithm it only requires one step to compute. Note that CNOT is the Oracle representing f(x)\=x.
qcode_demo2_desc=Grover\u2019s algorithm is a quantum algorithm used for searching. We define a function f (x), and make f (x) \= 1 if x is the solution to the search problem, and f (x) \= 0 for other values of x. In classical algorithm, it is necessary to iterate four times to find the object, while in the quantum algorithm it only takes one iteration to find the solution.
